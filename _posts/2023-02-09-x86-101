## Our First Assembly Workhop

Hey All, welcome to the first workshop we've had since our reformation. Today, we're covering x86 assembly, which will come in handy for any blue-teaming or malware analysis you end up doing in your careers. To get the challenges for today's workshop follow [this link](https://github.com/gusecurity/x86101).

Thanks,
